# Monte-Carlo-temperature-simulation

This project uses a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze and predict the distribution of daily mean temperatures based on historical weather data for Toronto. The simulation draws random samples from past temperature data to estimate future temperature variations and explore their statistical distribution.

## Project Overview
The project performs the following tasks:
- Reads and analyzes historical daily temperature data for Toronto.
- Uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate variations in daily mean temperatures.
- Produces a histogram and density plot to visualize the distribution of simulated temperatures.

## Dataset
The data is a CSV file containing historical daily temperature information, including mean, max, and min temperatures, as well as precipitation and seasonal data. The simulation uses the "Mean Temp (Â°C)" column.
